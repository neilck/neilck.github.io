Centralized identity is bad:

- Social media platforms censor speech by banning accounts which _MAY_ offend their advertisers
- Potential for real life attacks if identity is leaked
- Discrimination or personal attacks against minorities

Decentralized identity and pseudonymity is good:

- No one authority can unilaterally ban accounts and censor free speech
- Keeps digital life and real life seperate for safety
- Enables minorities be their true selves online without fear of discrimination

AKA Profiles mission is "access without identity".

Create your own pseudonymous profiles, and choose to share what's safe for you with apps.
